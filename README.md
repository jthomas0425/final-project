One of the primary challenges was integrating custom images into the game's interface. The turtle graphics library was used for visualization, which required images to be in GIF format. Converting high-resolution images to GIFs while maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the original artwork proved to be a meticulous task. Also we decided to abandon pygame since it was to diffucult for us to figure out so instead we used turtles and tkinter since we learned it in class.
Creating a Clicker game from scratch was an exhilarating journey, especially with our limited experience in Python. Every step of the process felt like unlocking a new level of understanding in coding. Starting with the basics of Python syntax and gradually diving into more complex concepts like functions, classes, each milestone felt like a significant achievement. The joy of seeing my code come to life as players clicked their way to collecting points was immensely satisfying. It wasn't just about the end product; it was more about the learning experience, the challenges we overcame, and the sense of accomplishment that came with it. This journey has not only strengthened our programming skills but also ignited a passion for game development that we never knew existed.
